  <h1>Short Story</h1>
  <br>
  This is a story about 4 kids, one dog, 14 river miles and one damn good time.
  <br>
  Every summer my roomates and I go on a fishing trip. In 2020 we decided to head to the
  Rocky Mountain Front and float the Sun River. We caught more fish than we could count,
  broke 2 rods, popped a tire on a truck, lost a phone, had to drag the boat over rocks the
  whole way, took out in the pitch black dark and could not have had more fun. You can
  always buy new rods and change flat tires, but you cannot replace these memories for anything.
  I will always remember my awesome college roomates and my great dog who came along on all
  of our adventures.
